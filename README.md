# A-Transformer-based-E-waste-Detection-System

## Overview

This project presents an AI-powered e-waste classification system using Vision Transformer (ViT), XceptionNet, VGG16, ResNet50, and CNN. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark Kaggle e-waste datasets, enhancing automated waste identification and recycling efficiency.

## Project Usefulness in Real Life

Automated Waste Sorting: Helps recycling centers efficiently categorize e-waste.

Environmental Impact: Reduces hazardous waste by improving recycling rates.

Smart Waste Management: Enables AI-driven classification to optimize e-waste disposal.

Scalability: Can be integrated into smart cities and industrial waste management systems.

## Features

Deep Learning Models: ViT, XceptionNet, VGG16, ResNet50, and CNN.

Multi-Dataset Performance: Evaluated on three Kaggle benchmark e-waste datasets.

State-of-the-Art Accuracy: ViT outperforms previous models in classification tasks.

Scalability: Deployable in real-world waste management systems.

## Dataset

We use three publicly available Kaggle benchmark e-waste datasets:
